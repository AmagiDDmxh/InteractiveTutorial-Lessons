Now we need a data type that encapsulates the three attributes of each Alien, and this is where classes come in. A class is a 'blueprint' for a type of object. It can have multiple variables of different data types, it can also have custom defined behaviours (methods, which we will cover later). 

For now, we will focus on classes that simply have multiple variables. 

Here is an example of a simple class: 

```c#
public class Point
{
    private int x;
    private int y;
}
```

The code above defines a new type of class called 'Point'. Here, each instance of 'Point' has two int attributes: x-corrdinate and y-coordinate. 

### Instructions: 

Define an Alien class that includes the three attributes we need for each 'Alien species': xna, name, and the block it was found on. 

- Define a struct called Alien
- The struct has three `private` variables: a `uint` named `xna`, a `string` named `alienName`, and a `uint` named `blockHeight`
