## Chapter 2: Variables and Unsigned Integers

When writing NEO contracts in C#, you can, for the most part, declare and use variables in the same way as in C#. There are however a few limitations[<sup>1</sup>](#1). 

As we go deeper in the tutorial, we will touch on more limitations. But for now, the first limitation regarding basic variable types is that floating types (`float` `double` `decimal`) are **not** supported in NEO contracts. 

#### uint and ulong

Here is an example of variable declarations: 

```c#
uint unsignedInt = 3281;
ulong unsignedLong = 847282; 
```

`uint` is a 32-bit unsinged integer with value ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295. It can also be declared as `uint32`

`ulong` is a 64-bit unsigned integer with value ranging from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. It can also be declared as `uint64`


#### string in NEO Contracts

You can declare `string`s in the same way that you can with `uint`. 

```c#
string cookingMethod  = "Poached"; 
string food = "Egg"; 
```

And all basic operations with `string`s such as addition, fetch length and taking substrings is supported for ASCII characters only. 

Examples: 

```c#
string combined = cookingMethod + " " + food;  // "Poached Egg"
int length = cookingMethod.Length;          // 7
string subString = cookingMethod.Substring(2); // "ached"
string subString2 = cookingMethod.Substring(2,3); // "ach"
```

### Try It Yourself: 

- Within the Main method, declare two uint values. One named blockHeight and the other one named xna.
