## Chapter 2: Variables and Unsigned Integers

NEO Contracts support most types of variables and operations in C#, which means, aside from a few exceptions,you can generally declare and use variables in the same way as in C#. 

One exception is that floating types (`float` `double` `decimal`) are not supported in NEO contracts. Here is also a documentation listing all the differences between C# and NEO contracts: [link](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/write/limitation.html)

#### uint and ulong

Here is an example of variable declarations: 

```c#
uint unsignedInt = 3281;
ulong unsignedLong = 847282; 
```

`uint` is a 32-bit unsinged integer with value ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295. 

`ulong` is a 64-bit unsigned integer with value ranging from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. 



### Try It Yourself: 

- Within the Main method, declare two uint values. One named blockHeight and the other one named xna. 

*Question*:

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {
    // enter answer here
    
    }
}
```

*Answer:*

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {
        uint blockHeight;
        uint xna; 
    }
}
```
