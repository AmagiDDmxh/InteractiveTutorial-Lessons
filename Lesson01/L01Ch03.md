## Chapter 3: Structs

Now we need a data type that encapsulates the three attributes of each Alien, and this is where the 'struct' type comes in. A struct can often have multiple variables of different data types. 

Here is an example of a simple struct: 

```c#
public struct Point
{
    private int x;
    private int y;
}
```

The code above defines a new struct called 'Point'. Here, each instance of 'Point' has two int attributes: x and y. 

### Try It Yourself - 1: 

Define an Alien struct that includes the three attributes we need for each 'Alien species': xna, name, and the 'planet' it was found on. 

- Define a struct called Alien
- The struct has three `private` variables: a `uint` named `xna`, a `string` named `alienName`, and a `uint` named `blockHeight`


*Question:*

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
	// enter answer here
	
	
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {
        uint blockHeight;
        uint xna; 
    }
}
```

*Answer:*

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
    struct Alien
    {
        private uint xna;
        private string alienName;
        private uint blockHeight;
    }
     
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {
        uint blockHeight;
        uint xna; 
    }
}
```



#### Constructors

After defining a struct, one way of creating new instances of it would be through constructors. 


```c#
public struct Point
{
    private int x;
    private int y;
    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

`public Point(int x, int y) {...}` is the constructor for new 'Points'. It takes two int parameters and creates a 'Point', whose x is equal to the first parameter, and y equal to the second. 

With the above struct definition, we can create a new 'Point' like this: 

```c#
var p = new Point(3, 5);
```


### Try It Yourself - 2

Add a constructor to the Alien struct, and create an 'Alien' in the Main method. 

- The constructor has three parameters: a `uint` named `xna`, a `string` named `alienName`, and a `uint` named `blockHeight`
- In the Main method, declare a `var` type called `someAlien`, make it a new Alien. For now, put in random attributes for the Alien. 

*Question:*

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
    struct Alien
    {
        private uint xna;
        private string alienName;
        private uint blockHeight;
        // enter your constructor here
        
    }
     
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {
        uint blockHeight;
        uint xna; 
        // create someAlien here
        
    }
}
```

*Answer:*

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
    struct Alien
    {
        private uint xna;
        private string alienName;
        private uint blockHeight;
        public Alien(uint xna, string alienName, uint blockHeight) 
        {
            this.xna = xna; 
            this.alienName = alienName;
            this.blockHeight = blockHeight;
        }
    }
     
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {
        uint blockHeight;
        uint xna; 
        var someAlien = new Alien(12345678, 'CookieMonster', 1);
    }
}
```
