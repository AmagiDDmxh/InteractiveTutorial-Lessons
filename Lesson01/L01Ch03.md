## Chapter 3: Structs

Now we need a data type that encapsulates the three attributes of each Alien, and this is where the 'struct' type comes in. A struct can often have multiple variables of different data types. 

Here is an example of a simple struct: 

```c#
public struct Point
{
    private int x;
    private int y;
}
```

The code above defines a new struct called 'Point'. Here, each instance of 'Point' has two int attributes: x-corrdinate and y-coordinate. 

### Instructions: 

Define an Alien struct that includes the three attributes we need for each 'Alien species': xna, name, and the block it was found on. 

- Define a struct called Alien
- The struct has three `private` variables: a `uint` named `xna`, a `string` named `alienName`, and a `uint` named `blockHeight`
