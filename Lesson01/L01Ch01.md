## Chapter 1: NEO Contracts

We start off by getting acquainted with the basic template of an empty NEO Contract:

```c#
using Neo.SmartContract.Framework.Services.Neo;

public class HelloWorld : SmartContract
{
    public static void Main()
    {

    }
}
```
#### The Main Method

The Main method is the entry point whenever a NEO smart contract is called. As a result, by defining the parameters and return types of the main method, you are defining what type of data the smart contract accepts and returns. 

So, a contract that accepts an integer as a parameter and returns a string would have a Main method like: 

```c#
public static string Main (int someInteger) 
{
  
}
```



### Try it yourself: 

- Create a contract called 'AlienFinder'. 


- The contract takes one string parameter called alienName and returns void



*Question:*

```c#
public class /*enter contract name here*/ : SmartContract
{
	// enter Main method here
}
```

*Answer:*

```c#
public class AlienFinder : SmartContract
{
    public static void Main(string alienName)
    {

    }
}
```
