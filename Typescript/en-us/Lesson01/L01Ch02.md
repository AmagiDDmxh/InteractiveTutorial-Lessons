When writing NEO contracts in TypeScript, you can, for the most part, declare and use variables in the same way as in TypeScript. There are however a few limitations. 

As we go deeper in the tutorial, we will cover more limitations. But for now, the first limitation regarding basic variable types is that floating numbers can **not** not be defined as `number` in NEO contracts. 

#### Number and Fixed<8>

Here is an example of variable initializations: 

```typescript
let int: number = 3281;
let float: Fixed<8> = 8_00000000;
```

Here we use the `number` type to represent interger, and the `Fixed` type to keep the value `8.00000000`. 

All numbers in a NEO smart contract must be integers (up to 256 bits, to be precise), so typically we use an integer multiplied by a power of 10 to represent decimals. In this case, `Fixed<8>` is telling the compiler that this number actually represents a fixed point number with 8 decimal places.

So here `float` is actually a BigNumber with the value of 8. This type has no impact on how the smart contract executes, but it does change how the automatically generated NEO client APIs function.


#### String in NEO Contracts

You can declare `string` in the same way that you can with `number`. 

```typescript
let cookingMethod: string = 'Poached'; 
let food: string = 'Egg'; 
```

And all basic operations with `string` are also available.

```typescript
let combined = cookingMethod + ' ' + food;  // "Poached Egg"
let length = cookingMethod.length;          // 7
let subString = cookingMethod.substring(2); // "ached"
let subString2 = cookingMethod.substring(2,3); // "ach"
```

### Instructions: 

- Within the `generateAlien` method, declare two `number` values. One named `blockHeight` and the other one named `xna`. (We will learn more about block height in Chapter 7)

- Add a input parameter in the format of string called `alienName` to the `generateAlien` method.
