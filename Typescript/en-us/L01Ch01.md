We start off by getting acquainted with the basic template of an empty NEO Contract:

```typescript
import { SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';

export class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```
#### Class and extention

Every NEO smart contract starts with a TypeScript source file that exports a single class extending SmartContract.

The simplest smart contract looks like: 

```typescript
export class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```

And all values that are not global can be imported from `@neo-one/smart-contract`:

```typescript
import { SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';
```



### Instructions: 

- Create a contract called `AlienFinder` from the template empty contract.


- Add a method called `createAlien` and let it receive and return nothing for now.
