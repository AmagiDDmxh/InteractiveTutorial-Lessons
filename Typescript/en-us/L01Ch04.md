A constructor can be declared to run arbitrary logic when the smart contract is deployed, because the constructor is called exactly once when the smart contract is deployed.

Although we are not going to extend it, this chapter will still introduce the constructor of NEO smart contract. We’ll also talk about verifying the calling address, i.e. who invoked the smart contract.

Let's look at an example:

```typescript
import { Address, Deploy, SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';

export class Example extends SmartContract {

  public constructor(public readonly owner: Address = Deploy.senderAddress) {
    super();
    if (!Address.isCaller(owner)) {
      throw new Error('Expected caller to be the owner');
    }
  }
}
```

Here we takes a special value `Deploy.senderAddress` as the default value of the contract constructor. It represents the address which deployed the contract.

By calling the `Address.isCaller` with `owner`, we are able to determine if the `owner` is the one who deployed the smart contract, which eliminates the possibility of accidentally setting the owner to an address that the publisher of the smart contract doesn’t own.

It should be mentioned that rather than returning `false` we always throw an `Error`. Not only is this more idiomatic TypeScript, but throwing an Error also has the side effect of reverting all storage changes. This ensures that when an assertion in an operation fails, there are no erroneous storage changes.
